Program description: There are 3 fighters to pick from: Human, Goblin, and a Beast. Each character has it's own unique stats. All specific characters extend an abstract Fighter class that sets up the basic functionality that all characters should have. Every turn the user encounters a new enemy and must either fight and kill it or try to escape. Note that this is a turn based fighting game and buttons are used for every interaction with the game to enhance the game's design as well as restrict any user input/output errors. For every kill the user gets, he/she gets HP, gold, and experience points added to their fighter. Once the user's fighter hits 80 experience points the fighter evolves to it's next form. A goblin turns into an Ogre, a Human turns into a Knight, and the Beast turns into a Dragon. Stats for the evolved form are boosted and user essentially wins the game at this point and is free to play around. Gold is used to buy food at the store that you visit every 4 turns. Also, gifs and pictures are added to engage the user more and create a dynamic gaming experience. If you want to play the game, download all the class files and picture folder and make sure to go into the source code for each class and change the file path to where it is located on your computer.
